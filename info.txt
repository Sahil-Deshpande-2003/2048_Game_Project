Code Flow:

1.Initialization (__init__ method):

The program starts by creating an instance of the Game2048 class: gamegrid = Game2048().
The __init__ method of the Game2048 class is automatically called.
In the __init__ method, the Tkinter frame is initialized, key bindings are set up, and initializations are performed.
The self.mainloop() method is called at the end, starting the Tkinter event loop.


2.Tkinter Event Loop (mainloop):

The mainloop() method enters the Tkinter main event loop, where it waits for user events (such as key presses, mouse clicks).
The program remains in this loop until the user closes the window.

3.Key Press Event (key_down method):

When a key is pressed, the Tkinter event system triggers a key press event. 
Relevant line : self.master.bind("<Key>", self.key_down)
The bound function, self.key_down, is then called to handle the key press.

4. Key Down Handling (key_down method):

The key_down method is responsible for handling key presses.
It retrieves the pressed key using repr(event.char).
It checks if the pressed key is a valid movement command ('w', 's', 'a', 'd').

5. Movement Commands (self.commands dictionary):

If the pressed key is a valid movement command, the corresponding function from the logicsfinal module is retrieved using self.commands[repr(event.char)].
For example, if 'w' is pressed, it retrieves logicsfinal.move_up.
The retrieved function is then called with the current game matrix (self.matrix) as an argument.
The function returns the updated game matrix and a boolean value (changed) indicating whether any changes were made.

6. Update UI and Add New 2 (update_grid_cells and add_new_2 methods):

If there were changes in the game state (i.e., changed is True), the UI is updated using self.update_grid_cells().
The self.update_grid_cells() method configures the labels in the grid cells based on the updated game matrix.
A new 2 is added to the matrix using logicsfinal.add_new_2(self.matrix).

7. Check Game State and Display Messages:

The code then checks the current state of the game using logicsfinal.get_current_state(self.matrix).
If the player has won or lost, it updates specific grid cells with messages ('You Win!' or 'You Lose!').

8. Repeat:

The program continues to wait for user input and events in the Tkinter event loop.
The process repeats as the user interacts with the game by pressing keys.
